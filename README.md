### Library Management System

This C++ application simulates a library management system. It allows you to manage books and members effectively, leveraging object-oriented programming principles.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features
1. **Books Management:**
  - Add a book with details like title, ISBN, and author information.
  - Display the list of available books.
  - Issue and return books with availability updates.

2. **Members Management:**
  - Add general and staff members with unique attributes (e.g., staff position).
  - Display members separately as general or staff.

3. **OOP Principles:**
  - Demonstrates inheritance, composition, and reusable methods for efficient coding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository using the following command:  
   `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler, e.g.:  
   `g++ main.cpp -o LibraryManagement`
4. Run the executable:  
   `./LibraryManagement`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Example Test Cases
1. **Adding a Book:**  
   Add a book titled "C++ Primer" with ISBN "1234" and author details. Verify it appears in the book list.

2. **Issuing and Returning a Book:**  
   Issue a book from the list, then return it. Check the availability status updates correctly.

3. **Adding Members:**  
   Add a general member and a staff member with position details. Confirm both appear under their respective categories.

4. **Displaying Members:**  
   Test displaying all members, ensuring staff and general members are listed separately.

## Additional Notes
- The system uses arrays to store books and members.
- The code avoids dynamic memory allocation and modern features to maintain simplicity.
- It is designed for learning purposes and is beginner-friendly.
